Arthur Mensch worked at Google DeepMind while Guillaume Lample and Timothée Lacroix worked at Meta Platforms. They met at the university where they studied AI from 2011 to 2014. 

In 2021, the three founders started talking about the direction they saw AI taking, noting the development of the technology was accelerating and that there was an opportunity to do things differently; instead of following a proprietary model approach, they argued for an open-source approach. Finally, Mistral AI founded in April 2023.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Mistral AI develops open-source foundational models. These are an alternative to closed, proprietary AI models like those developed by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The company also focuses on developing more efficient and cost-effective models, targeting the “performance-cost frontier.” For example, in October 2023 a third-party source estimated that the Mistral 7B model was about 187x cheaper than GPT-4 and 9x cheaper than GPT-3.5.

Mensch stated that the goal behind Mistral AI was “to create a European champion with a global vocation in generative artificial intelligence, based on an open, responsible, and decentralized approach to technology."
