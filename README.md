## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Mistral AI

* When was the company incorporated? April 2023

* Who are the founders of the company?
    * Arthur Mensch (Co-Founder & CEO)
    * Guillaume Lample (Co-Founder & Chief Scientist)
    * Timothée Lacroix (Co-Founder & CTO)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    * Arthur Mensch worked at Google DeepMind while Guillaume Lample and Timothée Lacroix worked at Meta Platforms. They met at the university where they studied AI from 2011 to 2014. 

    * In 2021, the three founders started talking about the direction they saw AI taking, noting the development of the technology was accelerating and that there was an opportunity to do things differently; instead of following a proprietary model approach, they argued for an open-source approach. Finally, Mistral AI founded in April 2023.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    * In October 2023, Mistral AI raised €385 million.[4] By December 2023, it was valued at over $2 billion.

    * In June 2024, Mistral AI announced a new funding round of €600 million ($645 million), significantly boosting its valuation to €5.8 billion ($6.2 billion). This round was led by the venture capital firm General Catalyst, with participation from existing investors

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    * Mistral AI develops open-source foundational models. These are an alternative to closed, proprietary AI models like those developed by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The company also focuses on developing more efficient and cost-effective models, targeting the “performance-cost frontier.” For example, in October 2023 a third-party source estimated that the Mistral 7B model was about 187x cheaper than GPT-4 and 9x cheaper than GPT-3.5.

    * Mensch (co-founder & CEO) stated that the goal behind Mistral AI was “to create a European champion with a global vocation in generative artificial intelligence, based on an open, responsible, and decentralized approach to technology."

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    - Mistral's AI models primarily targets businesses and organizations that require advanced
   AI solutions. Their intended customers include:
    - **Tech Companies**: Firms that need powerful AI models for natural    language processing, machine learning, and other advanced   
   computational tasks.
	 - **Large Enterprises**: Corporations seeking to integrate AI into their operations for efficiency, automation, and enhanced data
   analysis.
